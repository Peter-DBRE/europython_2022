tests look at the result of a behaviour

test broken down into 4 steps
arrange - prepare for tests (e.g. spin up a docker DB instance)
act - kick off the behaviour we want to test
assert - look at the state change and check it is how we expect
cleanup - e.e. stop and remove docker DB container

fixtures
a fixture provides a defined, reliable and consistent context for the tests
Fixtures define the steps and data that constitute the arrange phase of a test
They can also be used to define a testâ€™s act phase - technique for more complex tests (potentially useful if pytest-ansible fixtures are used to run tests)
specify a function is a fixture by adding @pytest.fixture on the preceeding row

pytest ansible extension
https://github.com/ansible-community/pytest-ansible
not compatible with latest versions of ansible. Hackathon idea? Can our opensource team update it? https://github.com/ansible-community/pytest-ansible/issues/54
