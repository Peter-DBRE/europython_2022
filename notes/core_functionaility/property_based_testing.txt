pytest parameterize - pass test data as parameters - quickly get a lot of test cases and miss edge cases


advantages of property based testing
less amount of code, cleaner test suite
Generated input data, more domain space
direct focus on general claim
better implementation/understanding of requirements

Hypothesis library
- write and run tests with pytest
-easy to generate data with strategies and tools
- finds edge cases
cons
difficult to debug when you ahve a large range of inputs
more difficult to design
slower to run


how does it work with non numerical data
more common and easier for numberical but possible for non numerical

how to test a given set of inputs create a given set of outputs - ideally in and out of yaml format
