eval() - really dangerous... injection?
- mainly though it's just bad coding practise - will be a better way to do it

arbirtary code execution with pickle - serialising a pyhthon object to aa sequence of bytes
when reloading sequence it can run malicious code
can create a reserse shelll
avoid by using a digest

pip install
- typo squatting - becoming more common for malicious pypi libraries to use a similarly named package
- also packages that are already built into pyhthon
use --require-hashes
never download  a package as sudo
only binary install option

outdated python
keep updated obvs
python versions get unsupported after 5 years

deprecated functions

pseudo-randomness
e.g. for generating passwords
random python module isn't really random, uses a deterministic seed
instead use secrets, os.urandom(),

random.systemrandom - this one is truly cryptographcally secure


xml pacgage can be insecure

extractall - be careful what you extractall

assert - need to read about this more


bandit - looks for insecurity in code

key  points
1. never trust user input
2. avoid running python as sudo
3. updates
4. read docs - look for warnings
5. use static code analysis tool
